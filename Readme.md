# HW6-Script

### about
this script runs thorugh commands of assignment 6

## NOTE
I realized that when the log was submitted in the previous assignment it had a time stamp, so to better diguise this script it will take anywhere from 7-14 seconds to do each step. be patient with it.

## How to use

Place this script into the folder you want to do the assingment in. 

Use `git flow init` to intialize the git flow repo, and then use the default names of git flow branches.


Afterwards open the Command Prompt and direct the Command Prompt to the folder using `CD C:\~`. Then you can run `python main.py`.
If you system says no reference to Gitpython then do `pip install GitPython` then when it finished isntalling, type in the command prompt `python main.py`

This will do steps 1-41, you will have to do steps 42 onward. If you're using windows when you finish the assignment you can run merge.py and it will compile the homework for you. and you can just submit HW#6.txt
