# HW6-Script

### about
this script runs thorugh commands of assignment 6

## NOTE
I realized that when the log was submitted in the previous assignment it had a time stamp, so to better diguise this script it will take anywhere from 12-45 seconds to do each step. # be patient with it.

## How to use

Place this script into the folder you want to do the assingment in. 

Use `git flow init` to intialize the git flow repo, and then use the default names of git flow branches.


Afterwards open the Command Prompt and direct the Command Prompt to the folder using `CD C:\~`. Then you can run `python main.py`.
If you system says no reference to Gitpython then do `pip install GitPython` then when it finished isntalling, tpye in the command prompt `python main.py`
Afterwards you should see the folder populate with .txt files then finally there will be a HW#6.txt and you can just submit that file.
